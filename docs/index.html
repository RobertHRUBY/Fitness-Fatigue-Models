							<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
							<p>We are a research group comprised of scientific researchers and industry professionals from the disciplines of sport and health science, strength and conditioning, data science, and statistics. Our focus is on the development of an open-source code base and educational resources to facilitate experimentation and education in predictive modelling applications for sport. In particular, our work is currently focussed on the study of existing fitness-fatigue models and methods for data fitting and approaches to address conceptual limitations in the underlying model structures. Our aim is to progress scientific understanding and development in the research area of fitness-fatigue modelling with respect to predictive capabilities for future use in training programme design. We hope to make progress toward this aim by improving the current availability of simple-to-use modelling tools and educational resources for researchers interested in conducting new experimental research. The project is open to others who are interested in contributing. Particularly researchers that wish to collaborate their own implementations for a new or existing model. Additionally, there is also scope to help with testing and debugging, and/or with future developments and extensions planned for the code base.</p>

							<h2>Motivation</h2>
							<p>A substantial increase in the collection of training and performance data spanning the last two decades in modern sport science practice presents a unique opportunity for researchers and practitioners to utilise techniques from areas such as informatics, mathematics and statistics to derive new knowledge of optimal training practice, generate predictions of future response, and inform decision and planning processes. Although there is a balance to be achieved, the combination of practitioner experience/intuition and domain expertise with quantitative skillsets directed into the development of areas such as data science can only serve to support future predictions, training decisions and intervention approaches. In typical academic research settings, (prospective) data collection usually only takes place over a finite and often limited period of time. However, in industry and professional sport the training process is cyclical and involves many test-adjust feedback loops that are not possible to study in controlled experimental intervention settings due to prohibitive costs and the level of commitment placed on participants. Therefore, despite certain inherent challenges and limitations associated with observational field data and retrospective analyses, there has never been a better opportunity in the history of the scientific field to bring researchers and practitioners together to collect, share and pool data and to use it to develop novel methods to study issues at the heart of daily practice.</p>

							<h2>Recent research</h2>
							<p>We have recently completed a two-part scientific review series that summarises the history, theory, mathematics and computational methods of fitness-fatigue modelling in sport and exercise science. Both reviews place importance on clarity in explanation of concepts, but part II also has an practical (instructional) emphasis on advanced methods including the Kalman filter and previously proposed methods to capture non-linearity in the training response; via external threshold saturation functions and internal changes to model structure. The series is available to read in <b>pre-print</b> (Part I and Part II), and the articles are also currently under scientific peer review. All feedback is welcomed. </p>

							<h2>A growing set of educational code resources</h2>
							<p>We have developed illustrative code (i.e. in a didactic-style) presented in notebook form which guides the user through the application of several advanced methods via an interactive procedural flow. Importance is placed on illumination the implementation of underlying concepts.</p>

							<h2>A cookbook of R functions for model fitting</h2>
							<p>The repository also includes robust utilities for fitting and evaluating FFMs with modern optimisers, cross-validation and input checking. Extensive documentation is provided along with code examples. The utilities are written in R to capture the growing trend of sport scientists adopting this statistical language as their primary tool for analysis of field and experimental data. These tools are under continued development and there are a number of planned additions and improvements scheduled for 2021.
