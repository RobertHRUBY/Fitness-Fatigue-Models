## Fitness-fatigue model notes and other files and documents

**Note**: Documentation for individual R functions is kept with the function itself in the [functions](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/functions) folder.

### Files

* **Fitness-fatigue_summation.xlsx** - Excel file demonstrating the calculation of the fitness-fatigue model from given parameters and training load values. It is a good illustration of the standard model function
* **Increasing_n_parameters.pdf** - PDF demonstrating various model formulae with increasing numbers of parameters derived from existing research
* **Undergrad_homework_tasks.docx** - Word file providing three tasks (2 in Excel, 1 in R) for computing the fitness-fatigue model. These would be good for introducing undergraduate exercise science students to the model and setting them something a bit challenging.
