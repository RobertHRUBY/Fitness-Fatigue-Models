## Fitness-fatigue model notes, files and lists of other resources

**Note**: Documentation for individual R functions is kept with the function itself in the [functions](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/functions) folder.

### Files

* [**Fitness-fatigue_summation.xlsx**](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/blob/main/notes/Fitness-fatigue_summation.xlsx) - Excel file demonstrating the calculation of the fitness-fatigue model from given parameters and training load values. It is a good illustration of the standard model function
* [**Increasing_n_parameters.pdf**](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/blob/main/notes/Increasing_n_parameters.pdf) - PDF demonstrating various model formulae with increasing numbers of parameters derived from existing research
* [**Undergrad_homework_tasks.pdf**](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/blob/main/notes/Undergrad_homework_tasks.pdf) - Three tasks (2 in Excel, 1 in R) for working with the fitness-fatigue model. These would be good for introducing undergraduate exercise science students to the model and setting them something a bit challenging.
