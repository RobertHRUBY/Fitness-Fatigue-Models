### Statement of Purpose

The Fitness Fatigue Model (FFM) is engrained within the workings of most sport 
science practitioners as a conceptual framework, however, we agree with many others
that it may be beneficial for practitioners to move beyond a conceptual framework
and employ quantitative FFMs to assist with training prescription. In order to
move toward this end, initial preparatory work is required regarding factors that may
influence the potential usefulness of such models. In this study, we adopted a unique
research perspective (particularly in the field of sport science) that systematically
investigates the role of measurement error and testing frequency on the predictive
capabilities of a Fitness Fatigue Model using simulation.

We believe the simulation approach adopted here may be of interest to researchers as
a potential vehicle to study phenomena, generate practical insights, and assist with
identifying factors that should be considered prior to conducting empirical research.
Importantly, our findings have a number of practical applications, including insight that
if the model is to have a realistic chance of providing meaningful predictions, it should
be used with measures taken at high frequencies, and which also contain low measurement error. We also make a number of recommendations for future research applying FFMs. In particular, in order to assess the utility of FFMs in a practical context, we suggest that researchers perform cross-validation by using estimated parameters to assess prediction accuracy on un-seen data.
