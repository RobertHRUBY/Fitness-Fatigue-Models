# Utilities: An R toolbox for fitting and evaluating FFMs

This directory includes easy to use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) functions for fitting and evaluating FFMs with modern optimisation options, and cross-validation (assessment of model performance).  
  
*Under development:* The files in this directory are undergoing a major redevelopment, and as such the associated documentation is still on it's way. In the meantime, the code files themselves are mostly self-contained from an explanatory point of view.
