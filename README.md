## The fitness-fatigue model project: A hub for related resources

This repository has been put together to centralise fitness-fatigue model tools, resources, and simulation experiments in the exercise sciences. Included are tools and links ot resources that aim to assist in the development and implementation of models and methods in this area. All included files are updated from time-to-time so check back for updates.

### Repository organisation

| [functions](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/functions)   | Cookbook for FFMs (bespoke R functions, scripts, and accompanying documentation) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [resources](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/resources)   | Notes, research papers, link directories, other docs and files                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [simulations](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/simulations) | Study code and data files from experimental simulations run as part of my PhD    |

The files in [**functions**](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/functions) form the backbone of this repository, and are mostly estimation functions which include cross-validation methods such as 'expanding window'. Functions are written to be ready to use by researchers and practitioners, and include input validation checks and error handling. I am also in the process of helping to develop an R package called [dorem](dorem.net) which aims to facilitate dose-response modeling in R, however this is not as complete as the functions individually.

I recommend that users review the accompanying documentation for each function.

### Get involved or raise an issue

If you would like to contribute a file to this repository, have suggestions, or have found bugs or errors please raise an issue via github on this repository (leave a contact address if you would like) and I will get back to you.

Note: *Code files themselves reflect authorship in the event it differs from myself.*
