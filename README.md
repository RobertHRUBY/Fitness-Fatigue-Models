# The FFM Project (Code Repository)  
*Associated review:* [Part I](https://osf.io/preprints/sportrxiv/ap75j/) [Part II](https://osf.io/preprints/sportrxiv/5qgc2)

## Introduction

This repository is an open-source code base associated with a scientific research project investigating predictive models of physical training and performance in sport science. The repository is focussed on providing flexible [code tools](software/utilities) for fitting and evaluating fitness-fatigue models (FFMs), with modern optimisers and cross-validation. In addition, educational resources are provided in the form of [illustrative code](software/illustrative) notebooks in a didactic-style. These guide the user through the application of several advanced methods via an interactive procedural flow. Documentation, explanatory examples, and mock data are provided with each resource.

The aim of this repository is to expedite research and development of FFMs and associated methods, and reduce initial barriers to study in sport and exercise science. It is hoped the resources contained will be useful to researchers, educators, students, and practitioners alike. The repository is not an endorsement of these models as "ready to use". Rather, it is a set of tools to aid understanding, accelerate scientific research, and enrich discussion in performance modelling and FFMs.

## Navigating this repository

The main folder of the repository is [software](software). From there, the user can access the [utilities](software/utilies) folder, where they can find annotated code files containing R functions for implementing and fitting the various models, or the [illustrative](software/illustrative) folder which contains didactic code resources and notebooks for learning about various FFMs.
