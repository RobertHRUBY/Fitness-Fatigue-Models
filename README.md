## The fitness-fatigue model project: A hub for related resources

This repository has been put together to centralise fitness-fatigue model tools, resources, and simulation experiments in the exercise sciences. Included are tools and links to resources that aim to assist in the development and implementation of models and methods in this area. All included files are updated from time-to-time so check back for updates. Please see the collaboration section below if you are interested in contributing.

### Repository organisation

| Directory   | Description                                                                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [functions](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/functions)   | Cookbook for FFMs (bespoke R functions, scripts, and accompanying documentation) |
| [resources](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/resources)   | Notes, research papers, link directories, other docs and files                   |
| [simulations](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/simulations) | Study code and data files from experimental simulations run as part of my PhD    |

- Files in [functions](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/functions) are primarily estimation functions which include cross-validation methods such as **expanding window**. 
- Functions are written to be as easy as possible to use out of the box, by researchers and practitioners. Most include input validation checks and error handling. 
- I recommend that users review the accompanying documentation for each function

### Get involved (contribute) or raise an issue with one of the files
