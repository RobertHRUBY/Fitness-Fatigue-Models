## Fitness-fatigue model resources

This repository centralises my fitness-fatigue model tools, resources, and experiments that I have developed or that have been developed within collaborative research projects. The aim is to provide helpful code resources for those interested in fitness-fatigue modeling in exercise science. Particularly tools to assist with the development and implementation of models and methods currently available. All included files are updated from time-to-time so check back for updates.

### Repository organisation

 - [**resources**](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/resources) : general notes, papers, lists of great resources and historical research, and other docs
 - [**functions**](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/functions) : a cookbook for FFMs (bespoke R functions, scripts, documentation)
 - [**simulations**](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/simulations) : study code files from experimental simulations

The files in [**functions**](https://github.com/bsh2/Fitness-Fatigue-Model/tree/main/functions) form the backbone of this repository, and are mostly estimation functions which include cross-validation methods such as 'expanding window'. Functions are written to be ready to use by researchers and practitioners, and include input validation checks and error handling. I am also in the process of helping to develop an R package called [dorem](dorem.net) which aims to facilitate dose-response modeling in R, however this is not as complete as the functions individually.

I recommend that users review the accompanying documentation for each function.

### Get involved or raise an issue

If you would like to contribute a file to this repository, have suggestions, or have found bugs or errors please raise an issue via github on this repository (leave a contact address if you would like) and I will get back to you.

Note: *Code files themselves reflect authorship in the event it differs from myself.*
